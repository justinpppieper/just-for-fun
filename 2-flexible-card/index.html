                        land, to restore Hyrule. Exactly why Link was sleeping and where on the timelines this places
                        Link is still a mystery.

                        exception of Skyward Sword, where she is portrayed as an ordinary girl before the kingdom of
                        Hyrule had been established. Princess Zelda is one of the three most important characters of The
                        Legend of Zelda series, which is also why her name appears in the title of every game.
