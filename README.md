This is a repository to collect small and fun exercises.

## 1. Glass Panel
A game panel build with only html and css, with gradient color background and elements. Looks like glass!

## 2. Flexible Card
A group of character cards with javascript animation. Still, took Zelda as an example, which is my favorite game recently...also, a time-consuming monster.
